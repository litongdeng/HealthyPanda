  <h1>The 4F Trauma Responses</h1>
  <p>We’re sure you’ve heard the pairing “fight or flight” plenty of times by now. It’s when animals, including humans, run away or prepare for battle. Except… not really. When it comes to mental health, there’s more than two reactions. And what happens because of them can vastly vary. </p>
  <h2>Automatic Reactions</h2>
  <p>Your brain is constantly making tiny decisions in the background that you don’t even notice. The 4F Trauma Responses are what reaction your brain chooses for you when it thinks you’re in danger.</p>
  <p>Even though the name of these reactions says “trauma”, they don’t have to be related to trauma. Trauma can strongly influence which reaction is engaged and what your brain thinks is dangerous. But so can you. Trauma can make people get “stuck” using certain reactions even when they aren’t helpful. In contrast, the “healthy” state is to be able to use whichever reaction will have the best outcome. Therapy, especially Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and reflection can both help you retrain your reactions.</p>
  <h2>The Basics</h2>
  <p>Let’s start off with the basic basics. <b>Fight</b> is the reaction type where someone responds aggressively to perceived danger. They might argue, get angry, or even be physically violent. This reaction includes passive-aggressive actions and covert ways to get back at someone, too. <b>Flight</b> ecompases a huge range of avoidant reactions. Usually, the flight reaction means someone avoids or distracts themselves from a problem. You might overexercise, become a perfectionist, or spend all day on your phone. </p>
  <p>We’re going to add another type now. It’s sometimes included with the “fight or flight” pairing. <b>Freeze</b> is when someone stops or pauses. Most of the time, it happens just for a little while before another response is chosen. However, freeze can become its own response when something else doesn’t get chosen. How it looks can overlap a lot with flight. Someone engaging this reaction might physically freeze, or they might oversleep, daydream constantly, or detach from a situation they don’t like. </p>
  <p>The final type is the one you’re least likely to already know. <b>Fawn</b> is when someone avoids danger by trying to keep other people happy. It’s important to note here that all the reactions can happen even without actual danger. Someone who tends towards the fawn reaction might take care of others before themselves, refuse to see the flaws in someone, or have an underdeveloped self-identity. </p>
  <h2>But None Of Those Sound Like Me?</h2>
  <p>That could mean you haven’t recognized the patterns in your life yet, or it could mean you don’t have a type. The patterns caused by the different types are all very vague. Additionally, most people aren’t just one type. They’re a mix or they have different types for different ‘categories’ of situations. Someone might argue endlessly for external threats but avoid internal threats without even realizing. Not having a type at all likely means you use the best reaction for each situation and/or don’t engage a danger response unnecessarily. This is usually the ideal and it’s what the users of HealthyPanda are working towards.</p>
  <h2>What Now?</h2>
  <p>Observe your reactions and habits. Knowing these types- and eventually figuring out yours- will help you realize ways you’re making life harder for yourself in the long run. If your reactions are out of control, it can be extremely destructive to your relationships and/or mental health. In fact, many mental health conditions are essentially 4F reactions that are unproductive or overactive. PTSD, phobias, anxiety, and more can all be traced back to the reactions. Knowing about the 4F reaction types is an important tool in coping with and treating these conditions. On a daily basis, your reaction type could be interfering with your life and goals without you even noticing. </p>
  <p>You are now better able to know yourself, your behaviors, and what you need to work on. Don’t let this go to waste- make it a habit to reflect on yourself so that you will always spot the 4F reactions in play. </p>
